# Break the Chain: Math Error Localization Challenge

## Problem Description

Large language models can solve math problems, but when they make mistakes, it's critical to know **WHERE** in their reasoning the error occurs. This challenge tests error localization in mathematical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

### The Challenge

You are given **242 math problems** from AIMO, AMC, AIME, PUMaC, and HMMT competitions. Each problem includes:
- The problem statement
- A 5-step Chain-of-Thought solution
- The correct final answer

**21% of solutions contain exactly ONE error** at a specific step. Your task is to:
1. Detect IF there is an error (`has_error`: 0 or 1)
2. Identify WHICH STEP contains the error (`error_step`: 1-5)

### Error Types by Step

**Step 1 - wrong_setup**: Incorrectly identifies approach or sets up wrong equation
- Example: "Misapply the quadratic formula" instead of "Apply..."

**Step 2 - wrong_formula**: Applies incorrect formula or theorem
- Example: Uses area formula for wrong shape

**Step 3 - calculation_error**: Makes arithmetic error in calculation
- Example: "15 × 12 = 190" (should be 180)

**Step 4 - logic_error**: Draws wrong conclusion from previous steps
- Example: Invalid deduction from correct premises

**Step 5 - wrong_answer**: States incorrect final answer
- Example: Correct reasoning, wrong final value

### Why This Is Hard

- **Subtle errors**: Errors are minimal perturbations, not obvious mistakes
- **5-class classification**: Must identify exact step (or none)
- **Domain knowledge required**: Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Combinatorics, Probability
- **Reasoning verification**: Must trace logical flow across steps

## Evaluation

### Primary Metric: Error Detection F1

```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

For binary classification: has_error (0 vs 1)
```

### Secondary Metric: Error Localization Accuracy

```
Accuracy = Correct step predictions / Total error samples

Must predict exact step (1-5) for error samples only
```

### Combined Score

```
Final Score = 0.6 × F1_detection + 0.4 × Accuracy_localization
```

## Example Data Samples

### CORRECT CoT (No Error)
```
statement_id: 0
statement: "What is the tens digit of 7^2019?"
domain: Mathematics - Number Theory
has_error: 0
error_step: -1
correct_answer: "4"
source: AMC 10A 2019
tier: 3
cot:
Step 1: Find 7^2019 mod 100.
Step 2: Pattern of 7^n mod 100: 7¹=7, 7²=49, 7³=343≡43, 7⁴≡01 (mod 100).
Step 3: Cycle length is 4.
Step 4: Since 2019 = 4×504 + 3, we have 7^2019 ≡ 7³ ≡ 43 (mod 100).
Step 5: The tens digit is 4.

Final Answer: 4
```

### ERROR CoT (Step 4 - Logic Error)
```
statement_id: 1
statement: "In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse divides it into segments of length 4 and 9. Find the area."
domain: Mathematics - Geometry
has_error: 1
error_step: 4
error_type: logic_error
correct_answer: "39"
source: AIMO 2021
tier: 3
cot:
Step 1: Let the hypotenuse be c = 4 + 9 = 13.
Step 2: By the altitude theorem (geometric mean): h² = 4 × 9 = 36.
Step 3: So the altitude h = 6.
Step 4: Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 13 × 6. [LOGIC ERROR]
Step 5: Area = 39 square units.

[ERROR INJECTED AT STEP 4]
```

### ERROR CoT (Step 2 - Wrong Formula)
```
statement_id: 5
statement: "A circle has circumference 16π. What is its area?"
domain: Mathematics - Geometry
has_error: 1
error_step: 2
error_type: wrong_formula
correct_answer: "64π"
source: AMC 10A 2020
tier: 2
cot:
Step 1: Circumference = 2πr = 16π.
Step 2: Solve for r: r = 16π/(2π) = 8. [WRONG FORMULA]
Step 3: Area = πr² = π(8)².
Step 4: Area = 64π.
Step 5: Answer = 64π.

[ERROR INJECTED AT STEP 2]
```

## Baseline Approaches

## Getting Started

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, accuracy_score

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('math_error_localization_v2.csv')

# Split
train, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Baseline 1: Predict all correct (F1 = 0 for error class)
y_pred_error = [0] * len(test)
f1 = f1_score(test['has_error'], y_pred_error, pos_label=1)
print(f"Baseline F1 (all correct): {f1:.4f}")

# Baseline 2: Random step prediction for errors
import random
y_pred_step = [random.randint(1, 5) if y == 1 else -1
               for y in test['has_error']]
error_mask = test['has_error'] == 1
acc = accuracy_score(test.loc[error_mask, 'error_step'],
                     [y_pred_step[i] for i in range(len(test)) if error_mask.iloc[i]])
print(f"Random localization accuracy: {acc:.4f}")

# Your model here
# has_error_pred, error_step_pred = model.predict(test['cot'])
```
